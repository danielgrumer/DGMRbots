A collection of scripts I made for Glyphs App

All made in Nina Stossinger's approach of "Code like nobody's watching".
I'm not a developer, and those were made for personal and project-based use.

So it's not so much Plug & Play. no interfaces. and it does require good understanding of how Glyphs scripting works.

Backup your files before you do anything with it...
